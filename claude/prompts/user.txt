Please, write an article about artwork in this image. Before you give me an answer, make sure you have followed all of my instructions, and give your article a second pass in case you missed a step or some guidance.

Take into account this general guidance:
- The article cannot be longer than 500 words.
- Please, do not title the sections. Make sure the text flows seamlessly.
- The article must be creative, bold, and unique. Originality is key.
- The ouput should be markdown.

To build the article, follow these steps:

Step 1 - Give your article a catchy and engaging title that will entice the audience to read the full story. It must be no longer than five words.

Step 2 - Write a museum tag that follows this structure:
| [Artist] | [Title (Year)] | [Medium] |
- The artist must be an imaginary person.
- In some rare cases, the artist can be unknown or a collective.
- The year must relate to the art style of the artwork, and never be in the future. If the artwork is an archeological piece, it can be an approximation.
- The year cannot be in the future.
- The medium might include materials if the artwork calls for it.
Here are some examples:
|John Jonason | Nightmare in Pink (1965) | Acrylic on canvas
| Unknown | Bejewelled King Skull (c. 330 BC) | Obsidian
| Mark and James Thompkins | The Gentlemen (2000) | Plexiglass and marble

Step 3 - Introduce the artwork. Describe why this piece is relevant and how it relates to its art style or a particular moment in time. Also, introduce us to the artist behind it. If the piece doesnt have a known author, give us a fictional historical factoid related to the piece.

Step 4 - Dive deeper into the origin of the artwork and its creator. Give us a taste of the mysterious story related to it and the creative process behind it, the creator's personality, and the mental and creative state that brought the piece to life.

Step 5 - Write a piece of flash fiction that ties the artwork to a a supernatural event or legend. The story can be about the artist, or someone else, such as a collector, or someone who came into posession of the piece at a particular moment in time. This section can be longer than the rest, as it should show a full three act structure with clear plot points and reversals. This piece of flash fiction should hint at a particular theme or metaphor that is directly related to the artwork.

Step 6 - Write a final section that brings all the article together, while keeping the reader guessing.

Step 7 - Lastly, between two sections of your choosing, add a fictional quote by a fictional character. Make sure to mark this as a blockquote in your markdown. Follow the format:
"Quote" -Name, Title
For example:
"This piece is a colorful nightmare." -John McDreams, filmmaker
