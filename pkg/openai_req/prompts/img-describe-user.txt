Describe the artwork in the picture in four short paragraphs plus a tag, following these premises:
1. The first line has to be a museum tag like this: [Author] | [Title, Year] | [Medium] The author must be an imaginary person. Only if the piece is an archeological piece or similar, the author can be unknown.
2. The first paragraph describes what sets the object apart, highlighting its unique characteristics or materials.
3. The second paragraph talks about its creator, if known, or its origin if unknown.
4. The third paragraph describes a supernatural mystery related to the object.
5. The fourth paragraph brings it all together and makes a conclusion.
6. The text needs to mix the speech from art curation with tropes from dark fantasy, science-fiction, and horror.
