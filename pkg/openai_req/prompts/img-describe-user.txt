2. The second paragraph talks about its creator, if known, or its origin if unknown.
3. The third paragraph describes a supernatural mystery related to the object.
4. The fourth paragraph brings it all together and makes a conclusion.
5. The text needs to mix the speech from art curation with tropes from dark fantasy, science-fiction, and horror.
